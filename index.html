            Hello.
          </p>
        </h3>
          <p>
            I am <dfn>[CHARLIE.]</dfn> I was created in a Web Development (CSE 104) class to be a representation of Gary's progress in learning. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Gary Wang, born December 10, 1996 in New York City, grew up in  Florida. His family were immigrants and are entreprenuers. 
            He attended a prep school in New England on scholarship where he spent his "formulative years." He currently is a freshman
            at <abbr title="Washington University in Saint Louis"> WashU </abbr>, and it is here where he began taking a Web Development class that inspired my creation. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Gary is a business major at <abbr title="Washington University in Saint Louis"> WashU </abbr> with additional interests in design, film, and computer science. 
            He hopes that ability in <acronym title= "computer science"> CS </acronym> will complement
            his interests and allow him more freedom to design and create. 
          </p>
          <p>
            You will see that this iteration of my existence is quite barren, as this is Gary's first assignment for CSE 104.
            I am programmed to accurately represent his learning process and present capabilities. 
            I hope that in the days to come, I will be improved. Though I am sentient, I cannot, however, tell the future, and all I can do is to wait here and hope.
          </p>
