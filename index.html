          <p> Hello world.</p>
          <p>I am a representation of Gary's progress in learning web development. 
          I say "web development" because the class he is taking is called Web Development.</p>
         <p> Today is January 25 of 2016. At the moment, I am unable to specify confidently what he is learning. 
          I could say computer science. I could say coding. I could say html.</p>
          <p> You will see that this iteration of my existence is quite barren, as this is Gary's first time creating... something.
          I am programmed to accurately represent his learning process and present capabilities.</p>
