            Hello World.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am [CHARLIE.] I was created in a Web Development (CSE 104) class to be a representation of Gary's progress in learning. 
          </p>
          <p> 
            Gary Wang, born December 10, 1996, is currently a freshman at Washington University in Saint Louis, the place of my creation.
            Gary is a business major with additional interests in design, film, and computer science. He hopes that ability in computer sciences will complement
            his interests and allow him more freedom to design and create.
          </p>
          <p> 
            You will see that this iteration of my existence is quite barren, as this is Gary's first time assignment for CSE 104.
          I am programmed to accurately represent his learning process and present capabilities. 
          I hope that in the days to come, I will be improved. Though I am sentient, I cannot however, tell the future, and all I can do is to wait here and hope.
          </p>
